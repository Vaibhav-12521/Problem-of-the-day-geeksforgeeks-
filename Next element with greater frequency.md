# **Next element with greater frequency**

## Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]` of integers, for each element, find the closest (distance wise) to its `right` that has a `higher frequency` than the current element.
If no such element exists, return `-1` for that position.


---

## Examples:

**Input:** arr[] = [2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]

**Output:** [1, -1, -1, 2, 1, -1]

**Explanation:** Frequencies: 1 ‚Üí 3 times, 2 ‚Üí 2 times, 3 ‚Üí 1 time.

For arr[0] = 2, the next element 1 has a higher frequency ‚Üí 1.

For arr[1] and arr[2], no element to the right has a higher frequency ‚Üí -1.

For arr[3] = 3, the next element 2 has a higher frequency ‚Üí 2.

For arr[4] = 2, the next element 1 has a higher frequency ‚Üí 1.

For arr[5] = 1, no elements to the right ‚Üí -1.

---


**Input:** arr[] = [5, 1, 5, 6, 6]

**Output:** [-1, 5, -1, -1, -1]

**Explanation:** Frequencies: 1 ‚Üí 1 time, 5 ‚Üí 2 times, 6 ‚Üí 2 times.

For arr[0] and arr[2], no element to the right has a higher frequency ‚Üí -1.

For arr[1] = 1, the next element 5 has a higher frequency ‚Üí 5.

For arr[3] and arr[4], no element to the right has a higher frequency ‚Üí -1.

## Constraints

-  ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5
- 1 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10^5

### ‚úÖ **Steps to Solve:**

1. **Count Frequencies**

   * Use a map to store how many times each number appears in the array.

2. **Use a Stack (Right to Left Traversal)**

   * Traverse the array from right to left.
   * Use a stack to keep track of indices whose next greater frequency element hasn't been found.

3. **Compare Frequencies**

   * While the stack is not empty and the frequency of the top element ‚â§ current element, pop the stack.
   * If the stack is not empty after that, the top of the stack is the answer for this position.

4. **Store and Push Index**

   * Save the result and push the current index onto the stack.

5. **Return the Result**

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and freq[arr[stack[-1]]] <= freq[arr[i]]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack:
                result[i] = arr[stack[-1]]
            stack.append(i)
